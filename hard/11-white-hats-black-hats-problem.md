White hats and black hats
--

Three students who were the finalists of a math contest were invited to a game show. 

The rule of the show was the following:

- There were 5 hats: 3 whites and 2 blacks. 
- All three students were blindfolded and each had one hat put on them.
- The remaining two hats are then hidden.

When the blindfolds were removed, the rule of the show was announced to the student, and that the first person who could tell the color of the hat put on their head wins. Three students were silent for a while observing each other, and finally one student announced that they figured they were wearing a white hat.

How did the student figure that out?
