The twin sisters
--

I used to live next to a town where a pair of famous identical twin sisters lived. They are named Emma and Sophia, respectively. Emma always lies on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday; on other days of the week she always tells the truth. Sophia always lies on Tuesday, Friday, and Saturday; on other days of the week she always tells the truth. 

The other day I met the twins, and asked one of them:

- Who are you?

- I am Emma.

- What day is today?

- Yesterday was Sunday.

The other twin added:

- Tomorrow is going to be Friday.

I was surprised -- how could it be -- and asked her:

- Are you telling the truth?

And she said:

- I'm always telling the truth on Wednesdays.

The twins got me confused for a while, but after a while I figured out who was who, and I even figured out what day it was that day.

Can you?
