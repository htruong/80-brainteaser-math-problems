A young man's achievement
--

I am a good chess player, but two of my friends are even better players. If I play with any one of them, I get beaten hands-down. I have another young friend who is only 10 year old, who just learned to play chess. But he claimed that he can play better than me. He claimed:

"I can play with both of your friends at once, and I can get a better result than you would have if you did, which is to get beaten by both."

How did he manage to do that?
