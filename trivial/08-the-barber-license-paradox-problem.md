The barber license paradox
--

A particular town has enacted a new law on the barber license:

"A person is a barber if that person shaves all people who don't shave themselves and no one else."

So, should the barber shave himself?

- If he does, then he shaves a person that shaves himself. So he is no longer a barber.

- It he doesn't, then he doesn't shave at least one person (him) who doesn't shave himself. So he is no longer a barber.

What is the problem here, and can you tell what kind of paradox is this?
