Cruel immigration law
--

Once upon a time, there was a very cruel president. He didn't want anyone to immigrate to his country so he made a new law:


_Every immigrant has to answer the question: "What are you here for?"
If the person lies, then they will be hung to death.
If the person tells the truth, then they will be drowned to death._

The other day, a poor farmer crossed the border, was caught and then asked what he was here for. The soldier was just about to execute him. But he managed to answer something that was neither right nor wrong, so he couldn't be executed.

What did he say?
