Winner finishes last
--

Grisko and Oponos were two famous jockeys that rivaled each other in many horseracing contests. Finally, to break the tie, Grisko proposed: They would race for the last time and the horse that finishes last wins.

The race was held and there were a lot curious people pouring to the street to watch. When the race begun, not surprisingly neither of them even bothered to mount on their horses. The audience got quite frustrated and made a lot of noises: Seems like the race would never end.

An old man passed by the crowd, and asked what happened. When he was told what was happening, he said:

- Everyone, calm down. I will tell them something and they will race to the finish line.

He approached the two jockeys and whispered something to both of the jockeys. Upon hearing, they swiftly ran to the horses and raced each other to the finish line.

What did the old man say?
