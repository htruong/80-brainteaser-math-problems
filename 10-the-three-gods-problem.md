The three gods
--

Once upon a time, in a temple in an Eastern country far far away, there were three statues of three gods casted right next to each other. They are: the God of Truth that always tells the truth, the God of Lies that always lies, and the God of Chaos that sometimes tells the truth and sometimes lies. They looked identical to each other, so no one knows what to believe. 

A tourist visited the temple and asked the statue on the left:

- Who sits next to you?
- That's the God of Truth.

Then he asked the statue in the middle:

- Who are you?
- I'm the God of Chaos.

Then he asked the statue in the right:

- Who sits next to you?
- That's the God of Lies.

He exclaimed: I know who each of you are!

How did he do that?
