Where am I?
--

There was a tourist getting lost in either town A or B of a mythical beautiful country. Citizens of town A never lie, citizens of town B always lie. There are some citizens of town A in town B, and vice-versa.

Can you think of one question the tourist could ask the first random person in town to figure out where he is?
