# 80 Brain teasers

One of my favorite books that I read when I was young was "80 brain teasers" by Han Ngoc Duc. I do not know whether there is an equivalent book in English. So I post here all the translated problems.

All problems are family-friendly. Each problem here should have a logical answer that is not a joke/blunt answer. Many are perhaps a bit silly because they are meant for junior high school students.

If you want to see the answers or want to discuss your answer, open an issue ticket with the title being the filename - with the leading problem number.
