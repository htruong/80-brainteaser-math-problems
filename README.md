# Fun logic riddles

This is a collection of math/logic riddles. The first 80 problems are translated directly from the book "80 brain teasers" by Han Ngoc Duc (published in the 1980s in Vietnam). I do not know whether there exists an equivalent book in English. 

All problems are family-friendly and should not require a computer to solve. Each problem here should have a logical answer that is not a joke/blunt answer. 

They are categorized as follows:

- Trivial: The answer is trivial, has a catch, or widely known by now, should not require coherent/critical thinking.
- Medium: To come up with an answer, you probably need a pen and a paper but there is no catch.
- Hard: A pen and a paper won't save you.

If you want to see the answers or want to discuss your answer, open an issue ticket with the title being the riddle number - For example "Problem 4: Where am I?"
