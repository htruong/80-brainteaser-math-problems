# 80 Brain teasers

One of my favorite books that I read when I was young was "80 brain teasers" by Han Ngoc Duc. I do not know whether there is an equivalent book in English. So I post here all the translated problems.

Each problem here should have a logical answer that is not a joke/blunt answer. Many are perhaps a bit silly because they are meant for junior high school students and they are all family-friendly.

The answers will be added later if there is enough demand :)
